## Questions within instructions
_These two questions are worth a total of 4 points._

### Milestone 3

#### Should CachingMinimaxPlayer give the same results as MinimaxPlayer or better ones? Explain.
CatchingMinimaxPlayer do not give the same results as MinimaxPlayer. MiniMax had the results of 5,406,266 μs 5,406 ms	
5 s,while MinimaxPlayer had 42,479,793 μs 42,479 ms42 s as the result. Therefore, caching minimax is better because 
it had the lower time, us and ms. 


#### What is the timing output for the specified pairs of simulators on a size-3 board?
Minimax and Random
Time used by Minimax (White): 106,987 μs	106 ms	0 s
Time used by Random (Black): 129 μs	0 ms	0 s

RandomMax and Random
Time used by RandomMax (White): 55,751 μs	55 ms	0 s
Time used by Random (Black): 51 μs	0 ms	0 s

CachingMinimax and Random
Time used by Caching Minimax (White): 67,066 μs	67 ms	0 s
Time used by Random (Black): 82 μs	0 ms	0 s

### Milestone 4

####  What is the timing output when you run the following pairs of simulators on a size-5 board?

Minimax and Random
Time used by Minimax (White): 56,290,630 μs	56,290 ms	56 s
Time used by Random (Black): 172 μs	0 ms	0 s

RandomMax and Random
Time used by RandomMax (White): 54,287,749 μs	54,287 ms	54 s
Time used by Random (Black): 76 μs	0 ms	0 s

## Did you successfully implement everything that was requested, and does everything work,
to the best of your knowledge? This includes autograder tests.

_Answer "Yes", or state here which parts did not work or which tests did not pass.
This would also be the place to mention any optional milestones you completed_ [1 point]

Yes 
### Did you attend the class sessions where this assignment was discussed?
_You will not be penalized for not attending class. I would just like to
know how helpful attendance was for this assignment._ [1 point]
Yes 
### How long did the assignment take?

Rather than giving ranges, if you are unsure, give the averages of the ranges._ 
[1 point]
7 hours 

### Who did you work with and how?

_Discussing the assignment with people not on your team is fine as long as you
don't share code. Be sure to state how you worked together_ [1 points]
Peer TA Samyutha helped us better understand the putMove() implementation in the TranspositionTable class
Peer TA Angelina helped us to understand the implementations of the two methods in AlphaBetaPlayer.java 

### What resources did you use?
_Please give specific URLs/questions (not just "Stack Overflow" or "ChatGPT") and
state which ones were particularly helpful._ [1 point]

### Reflections
_Give one or more paragraphs reflecting on your experience with the
assignment, including answers to all of these questions:_

* _Were the tests helpful? If so, how?_
* _What was the most difficult part of the assignment?_
* _What was the most rewarding part of the assignment?_
* _What did you learn doing the assignment?_
* _What were your favorite assignments this semester? What were your least favorites?_

_Constructive and actionable suggestions for improving assignments, office hours,
and lecture are always welcome. If there was a TA who was especially helpful,
say so._ [4 points]

The test were helpful in our implementation because it allows us to know what we were missing in our code even if 
our code ran fine. The most difficult part of the assignment was milestone 4 and AlphaBeta implementation. The most 
rewarding part of this assignment was seeing the new classes be added and being able to use them. It was also rewarding
to see the differences between them. We learned about what alpha-beta pruning is and how to implement it into our code.
Our favorite assignment this semester would be Homework 5 the music one where we could import our own songs and make it 
play. Our least favorite assignment was Homework 3 especially the buildTable implementation.TA Angelina was especially
helpful for this assignment and gave us a lot of insightful tips.
