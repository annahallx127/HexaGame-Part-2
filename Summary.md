### Milestone 3

#### Should CachingMinimaxPlayer give the same results as MinimaxPlayer or better ones? Explain.
CatchingMinimaxPlayer do not give the same results as MinimaxPlayer. MiniMax had the results of 5,406,266 μs 5,406 ms	
5 s,while MinimaxPlayer had 42,479,793 μs 42,479 ms42 s as the result. Therefore, caching minimax is better because 
it had the lower time, us and ms.
